# IntraSphere - Plateforme E-learning Moderne

## Overview
IntraSphere is a modern, flexible Learning Management System (LMS) designed to provide a comprehensive and adaptive learning experience for multiple educational establishments, coupled with robust administrative capabilities. Its core vision is to offer a scalable, multi-tenant e-learning platform that centralizes management while isolating data per establishment. The project aims to provide a complete enterprise-grade LMS solution, including advanced content creation (WYSIWYG editor), assessment tools, group functionalities, and real-time communication features, with a focus on modern UI/UX and efficient performance.

## System Architecture
IntraSphere is built with a modern, modular architecture organized by business domains to enhance maintainability and scalability.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System:** Utilizes Shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive, and accessible interface, supporting both dark and light themes.
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first design approach ensuring optimal viewing across various devices.
- **Navigation:** Intuitive and user-friendly navigation structure.
- **Visuals:** Features a glassmorphism design with violet/blue color schemes and fluid animations.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend:** React TypeScript.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js, featuring a multi-tenant architecture. An alternative PHP vanilla implementation also exists, achieving 100% functional parity.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, managed with Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries and schema migrations (for Node.js version).
- **State Management:** Tanstack Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization (for React version).
- **Access Control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with granular permissions: Super Admin, Admin, Manager, Formateur, and Apprenant.
- **Project Structure:** Organized into `frontend/`, `backend/`, `shared/` (for common types and schemas), `config/`, and `deployment/` directories. Business logic is separated into features (e.g., auth, admin, content, training) on the frontend and services/routes on the backend.
- **API Design:** RESTful API with modular routes organized by domain (e.g., `/api/auth`, `/api/establishments`, `/api/courses`, `/api/users`).
- **Real-time Communication:** Integrated WebSocket for real-time features and notifications, including advanced collaboration functionalities (chat, whiteboard, live participants).
- **Content Management:** Advanced WYSIWYG editor for course creation, supporting reusable components and versioning.
- **Theming:** Advanced custom theme creation and management.
- **PWA:** Full Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities with push notifications and offline mode.
- **Security:** Implements enterprise-level security including CSRF, XSS, SQLi protection, Argon2ID hashing, and secure sessions.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **Multi-establishment Management:** Complete multi-tenant architecture with centralized establishment management and data isolation.
- **LMS Core:** Comprehensive learning functionalities including course management, assessments, study groups, and progression tracking.
- **Dashboard:** Adaptive dashboard displaying real-time metrics, reports, notifications, and a calendar.
- **User Management:** Comprehensive user and profile management.
- **Analytics:** Real-time analytics with charts and export capabilities.
- **Help Center:** Integrated documentation, FAQ, and support system.
- **System Monitoring:** Health checks, logging, and performance optimizations.
